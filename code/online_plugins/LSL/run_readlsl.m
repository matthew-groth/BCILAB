% Receive real-time data from a source on the lab streaming layer.
% run_readlsl(MatlabStream,SelectionProperty,SelectionValue,UpdateFrequency)
%
% This plugin connects to and receives data from a device on the lab streaming layer. The data source
% is specified by means of a query (some allowed properties are type, name, channel_count, and srate).
%
% In:
%   StreamName : name of the stream; a variable with this name will be created in the MATLAB workspace 
%                to hold the stream's data. If such a variable already exists it will be overridden.
%
%   DataStreamQuery : Data stream query. Allows to select an LSL data stream to read from (e.g., by setting 
%                     it to 'type=''EEG''' or 'name=''BioSemi'''). (default: 'type=''EEG''')
%
%   MarkerStreamQuery : Marker stream query. Allows to select an LSL marker stream to read from (e.g., by setting 
%                       it to 'type=''Markers'''). Leave it empty to ignore markers. (default: 'type=''Markers''')
%
%   ConvertToDouble : Always convert the signal to double precision. (default: true)
%   
%   UpdateFrequency : The rate at which new chunks of data is polled from the device, in Hz. 
%                     (default: 20)
%
%   BufferLength : Internal buffering length. This is the maximum amount of backlog that you can
%                  get, in seconds. (default: 30)
%
%   ChannelOverride : Override channel labels. This allows to replace the channel labels that 
%                     are provided by the stream. (default: {})
%
%   SamplingRateOverride : Override sampling rate. This allows to replace the sampling rate that is
%                          provided by the stream. (default: 0)
%
%   MarkerPlacement : Marker placement rule. Controls how the latency of markers is determined --
%                     can use fractional placement, which is based on the sampling rate (potentially
%                     the most precise, but requires that the sampling rate is well within 1% of the
%                     true value) or placement next to the nearest sample (also works for streams
%                     that have irregular sampling rate). (default: 'nearest')
%
%   ClockAlignment : Clock alignment algorithm. The algorithm used to smooth clock alignment
%                    measurements; if the clock drift between data and markers is assumed to be low
%                    (e.g., come from same machine), then median is the safest choice. If drift is
%                    substantial (e.g., on a networked installation) then one may use linear to
%                    correct for that, but if the network is under heavy load it is safer to use
%                    the trimmed or robust estimators. The trimmed estimator survives occasional
%                    extreme load spikes, and the robust estimator further improves that tolerance
%                    by 2x. The only issue with the robust estimator is that whenever it updates
%                    (every 5s) it delays the BCI output by an extra 15ms of processing time. Zero
%                    disables the time-correction. (default: 'median')
%
%   JitterCorrection : Correct for jittered time stamps. This corrects jitter in the time stamps of
%                      the data stream chunks assuming that the underlying sampling rate is regular
%                      but may drift slowly. (default: true)
%
%   ForgetHalftime : Forget factor as information half-life. In estimating the effective sampling rate 
%                    a sample which is this many seconds old will be weighted 1/2 as much as the
%                    current sample in an exponentially decaying window. (default: 30)
%
% Notes:
%   The general format of the queries is that of an XPath 1.0 predicate on the meta-data of a given stream.
%
%   Some older versions of MATLAB (solved since 2009a) cannot handle a sender disconnecting while
%   run_readlsl is running; on those versions you need to clear (i.e., stop) the stream before you
%   disconnect at the sender side, otherwise your MATLAB will hang.
%
% Examples:
%   % receive data from a device that contains gaze data
%   run_readlsl('mystream','type','Gaze');
%
%   % read from an EEG stream (default) but use custom channel labels
%   run_readlsl('ChannelOverride', {'C3','C4','Cz','O1','O2'};
%
%   % read from a stream that has the name 'PhaseSpace'
%   run_readlsl('SelectionProperty','name','SelectionValue','PhaseSpace')
